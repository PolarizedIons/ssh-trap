>There are two types of encryption: one that will prevent your sister from reading your diary and one that will prevent your government.

- Bruce Schneier 

## Problem

In the new era of Snowden and the NSA we need encryption tools accessible for everyone.

I really like ursa and I love encryption, but I wonder if anyone comes up quickly with a solution of encryptions buffer-length limitations. This module provides easy encryption for strings and buffers with any length!

It's quite useless for experienced users, but I hope with many following pull-requests it will help every user to develop an encrypted app quickly.

## Install

```
npm install node-noobcrypt
```

## Usage
    
```javascript
var crypt = require('node-noobcrypt');
var keypair = crypt.generateKeypair(); // [ publicKey, privateKey ]

crypt.encrypt('Hello World!', keypair[0], function(data) {
    crypt.decrypt(data, keypair[1], function(decrypted) {
        console.log(decrypted.toString()); // Hello World!
    });
});
```

## API

### function generateKeypair()

Generates a new Keypair with a strength of 2048 bits and an exponent of 65537. Returns an array with two objects: The public key and the private key.

### function encrypt(Buffer or String, Public Key, Callback(Data))

Encrypts a given buffer or string using a public key object. The encrypted data is returned via the callback function.

The encrypted data is a chain of base64 encoded strings joined by a '$'-sign.

### function decrypt(String, Private Key, Callback(Data))

Decrypts encrypted data using a private key object. The decrypted data is returned via the callback function.

### function publicKey(PEM)

Creates and returns a public key object from a given string in the PEM-format.

### function privateKey(PEM)

Creates and returns a private key object from a given string in the PEM-format.

### function getPublicPem(Public Key)

Creates and returns a string in the PEM-format from a given public key object.

### function getPrivatePem(Private Key)

Creates and returns a string in the PEM-format from a given private key object.
